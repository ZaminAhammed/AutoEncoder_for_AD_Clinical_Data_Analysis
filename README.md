Unraveling Alzheimer's: Drug Analysis through the Lens of Autoencodersâ€‹

METHODOLOGY:
1. Clincical trial data was retrieved from EU Clinical Trial Register for a study that focused on the effect of passive immunization by Solanezumab on the progression of mild Alzheimer's disease compared to placebo.
2. Simulation of data with selected 22 endpoints were performed using the "simulating_AD_data.R" script in RStudio 2024.04.02. The simulated data was read to csv file, which is also uploaded in the repository ("Simulated_AD_data.csv").
3. Employment of AutoEncoders and analysing their efficeincy is performed using "AutoEncoder_AD_Data_Analysis.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook.
